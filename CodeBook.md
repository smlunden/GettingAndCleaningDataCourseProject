activity  
	What activity was taking place as the measurement occurred  
		WALKING  
		WALKING_UPSTAIRS  
		WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS  
		SITTING  
		STANDING  
		LAYING  
		

subjectid  
	The id number given to each of 30 volunteers.  
		numbers 1 - 30  
		

The remaining columns are the average of all of the mean or standard deviation measurements for each activity-subject combination. The original data is normalized [-1,1]. The names notate the following:
>time or frequency for the type of domain signal (indicated by t or f in the original data)  
>body or gravity for the type of acceleration signal  
>acceleration or gyroscope for the type of measurement (indicated by acc or gyro in the original data)  
>mean or standard deviation (indicated by mean() or std() in the original data)  
>x, y, or z for the direction of measurement  
>jerk for jerk signals  
>magnitude for the magnitude of the 3D signals (indicated by mag in the original data)
